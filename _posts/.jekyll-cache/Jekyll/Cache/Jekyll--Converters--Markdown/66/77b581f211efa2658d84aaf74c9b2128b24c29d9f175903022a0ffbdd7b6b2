<p>Interview with philosopher Alexander Dugin to Tsargrad TV channel about a conceptual dispute with the ardent ideologist of liberalism Bernard-Henri Levy, the methods of struggle of modern liberals and how Russia can save itself in this struggle</p>

<p>Author: Kucher Egor</p>

<p>On September 21, on the stage of the famous Amsterdam Opera, a conceptual philosophical duel took place in the framework of the forum of the main liberal think tank, the famous Nexus Institute, in which the Frenchman Bernard-Henri Levy and the philosopher Alexander Dugin took part. Levy is the modern embodiment of liberalism and libertarianism, a man who took a lively part in the color revolutions and events of the Arab spring, called for the invasion of Libya and the elimination of Muammar Gaddafi, demanded the bombing of Belgrade and Damascus, personally inspired the crowd on the Maidan in Kiev in 2014. The track record of Alexander Dugin is not at all war, but books and articles, lectures, the modern concept of Eurasianism, multipolarity, conservatism and service to the motherland. After arriving in Moscow, Alexander Dugin told Tsargrad about his conceptual dispute with Levy, about</p>

<p>Constantinople: Alexander Gelievich, hello. On September 21, you had an absolutely incredible philosophical duel with the main Western ideologist of liberalism - Bernard-Henri Levy. The first thing that catches your eye is the aggression of your interlocutor, who turned to the individual, criticized you, your books, ideas and Russia as a whole. At the very beginning of the conversation, you told him that you prefer mental dueling over physical warfare. Why do you think the whole ideology that Levy supports is based on physical warfare, and not on the political process?</p>

<p>Alexander Dugin: You know, that ideology that Levy supports is, if you will, total and in some sense totalitarian. It includes all types of imposition: this is imposition through education, the media, culture, art, politics, through diplomacy and economics. It is important that Levy is the son of a large banker, whose fortune is estimated at more than half a billion dollars. He is part of this ‚ÄúRothschild-Soros‚Äù system, which manifests itself ideologically, economically and through war.</p>

<p>This ideology, like any totalitarian ideology in fact, uses all levels. Therefore, it cannot be said that liberals only fight. The battlefield is everything for them - from thought, feelings, technology to economics, including those wars that Levy himself is behind. He was one of those who persuaded Nicolas Sarkozy to invade Libya, kill Gaddafi. He supported all military interventions, starting with Yugoslavia and the invasion of Iraq. Levy was also one of the main agents in the struggle against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. That is, this is a man whose hands are up to the elbow in blood.</p>

<p>But this is not important. I wanted to hold a debate with the thinker, because he represents himself as such and calls it ‚Äúintellectual anger‚Äù - that is, ‚Äúengaged intellectual‚Äù. Engaged in the sense that he refers to liberalism, Western hegemony, capitalism and globalism as positive values, which he defends in a philosophical way. The last book that he wrote and in which he speaks of me in an unflattering way is called ‚ÄúThe Empire and the Five Kings‚Äù. The book is devoted to the philosophical defense of globalism. I wanted to talk about this, but, as you can see from the text, this was not entirely possible.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alexander Dugin: ‚ÄúFirst of all, I want to say that I prefer a battle of ideas rather than a real war. And I am very glad that I can exchange ideas with Mr. Bernard-Henri Levy, who is known throughout the world, not in the course of a real war - because sometimes we are on the same front line, but, as a rule, on different sides. Therefore, I prefer to exchange ideas here, rather than in a real battle. Perhaps this is the only way to avoid this, or at least try ‚Äù(from the discussion of A. Dugin and B.-A. Levy).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because all the philosophical questions addressed to the text of his book, he simply passed by. He spoke only about Politkovskaya, the terrible Putin, and so on. Instead of philosophical debate, which was supposed by the organizers to expose the problems of the next century, he preferred ordinary politicized agitation. By the way, not so far from what we hear from liberals in general, including our Russian ones.</p>

<p>At the same time, it seems to me that his books are much more interesting. They can be politically biased, this is understandable. It seems that he either forgot them, or did not read, or did not write at all. The feeling that he is much lower in level than his books.</p>

<p>Ts.: You also had a dispute about nihilism, which Levi considers characteristic of fascism and totalitarianism. Your interlocutor directly accused you of racism and this very nihilism, which, in your opinion, is characteristic of just Western civilization, which entered the period of the crisis of liberal ideas of globalism. In your opinion, why did Levy become personal and what caused his aggression in defending liberal ideas?</p>

<p>HELL.:The fact is that Levy took my point to the nihilism with which the debate began, completely wrong. I did not want to offend him. I simply raised the question of nihilism in the same sense in which it was raised by Nietzsche or Heidegger. Levy himself in his book ‚ÄúThe Empire and the Five Kings‚Äù writes that under the empire he understands the global dominance of the Western liberal system, which is based on ‚Äúnothing.‚Äù That‚Äôs what I wanted to talk about, and not about the fact that I rebuke him in some kind of nihilism. I told him: ‚ÄúLook, you write that the‚Äú empire ‚Äùis based on nothing. Her opponents are the ‚Äúfive kings‚Äù, a reference to biblical history. You reproach them with nothingness. It turns out that the empire defends ‚Äúnothing‚Äù, and these ‚Äúfive kings‚Äù - Russia, Iran, China, Turkey and Saudi Arabia - they are as if insignificant. ‚Äú I wanted to talk about this philosophical aspect,</p>

<p>That would be interesting philosophically. At least it‚Äôs not mine, but his ideas. But instead of speaking at the philosophical level with his language, at the level of his, and not my book, he switched to aggression. I read his mind, but he clearly didn‚Äôt read any of my books. Judging by what he says and what he accuses me of, it‚Äôs just excerpts from the English Wikipedia, which is full of all the insinuations of the globalists.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bernard-Henri Levy: ‚ÄúAnd although political modernity is probably in crisis, I refuse to believe in its irrevocable decline and, worse, in its disappearance. I refuse this, because I firmly believe that the preservation of liberal democracy is a plus for the whole world. Now let‚Äôs move on to nihilism. I also got acquainted with your work. You are my exact opposite. Our views differ on most issues. But I recognize your importance, at least for Russian society. That is why I carefully read your work. And for me you are the embodiment of nihilism today. Just like your friends. And the whole Eurasian current. And the painful atmosphere that your books are filled with ‚Äù(from a discussion by A. Dugin and B.-A. Levy).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead of a normal conversation, he accused me of fascism, but this had nothing to do with it, because I am not a defender of fascism. And in the end, we saw everything that should be characteristic of liberal speech.</p>

<p>Ts .: It turns out that your argument with him was useless, since you spoke at different levels?</p>

<p>AD: No, I think the debate was very good, despite this. They are very useful and much more important than it might seem. In general, Levy is one of those brave liberals who defend liberal ideology after its final failure. There are very few such people. Those who will today defend global capitalism, the American empire, and the ideology of complete libertarianism, as well as LGBT people, as if nothing had happened. And to do it so intrusively, consistently.</p>

<p>Moreover, he is one of the foreground figures. Firstly, he is one of the most famous representatives of liberalism, secondly, he was an adviser to the three presidents of France, thirdly, he is part of this global world system, a member of all American think tanks, and he represents globalism.</p>

<p>My task was to express an alternative point of view about these ‚Äúfive kings,‚Äù as he calls them. And to show that a multipolar world cannot be reduced to the primitive model that liberals operate on. And now, analyzing what I expressed in intelligible English on the stage of the Amsterdam Opera with a huge liberal-oriented audience (and this forum was made by one of the most prominent ultra-liberal think tank Nexus), I see that I was able to say what I think and how I see this an alternative. He spoke about multipolarity, which cannot be reduced either to fascism or to communism, which cannot be attributed to past eras of anti-liberal ideologies and which today takes a step forward.</p>

<p>I am pleased with this debate. This is serious and unknown. Everything Levi thinks is known to everyone - these are completely banal things. But what confronts Levy is that there are problems with understanding this. Each of the five civilizations that oppose globalization, or from circles like populists or even Trump, all oppose globalism with something of their own, something local, private. My appeal was that there are serious alternatives to the global liberal discourse, which fully embodies Levy. I represented not only and not so much Russia as one of these ‚Äúfive kingdoms‚Äù, but I wanted to outline all possible alternatives to the Western ‚Äúempire‚Äù, including Chinese civilization, Islamic and Middle Eastern. And, in fact, this is the battle of ‚Äúliberalism against humanity.‚Äù</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alexander Dugin: ‚ÄúI believe that democracy, its very essence, is changing. I once spoke with Fukuyama, and he defined the modern understanding of liberal democracy as the rule of the minority over the majority, since the majority can always be transformed into populism, fascism and communism. Therefore, I think this is a completely new idea. And I do not share this new understanding of liberal democracy, I doubt that the subject of freedom should be a person, and this is precisely what underlies the ideology of human rights. I believe that the identity of a person, human culture, society is not reduced to individuality. For example, in our Russian tradition, the subject of freedom or a person is not individual, but collective ‚Äù(from a discussion by A. Dugin and B.-A. Levy).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But Levy - this is liberalism. Here he is, such hegemony. Shallow, banal, vulgar - yes, everything is correct. But here it is, it is. And he expresses how global elites think, as Obama, Hillary Clinton thought, and thinks the whole western establishment in general. So they are Levy.</p>

<p>Ts.: But what about ideas in defense of nation-states that are opposed to globalism?</p>

<p>AD: I did not defend national states. National states are local resistance to globalization. I defended the foundations and philosophy, the very metaphysics of a multipolar world. Incidentally, Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke well about this at the Valdai Forum. He said that we need to protect several centers of power, several civilizational structures. These are not just nation states, he talked about civilizations.</p>

<p>As far as my debate with Levy allowed, I have formulated certain principles that underlie those ‚Äúfive kings‚Äù - the five civilizations that oppose globalization.</p>

<p>And the main principle is the principle of understanding the other. Because the West understands others as themselves. Therefore, anyone who is not a liberal is considered a fascist, nationalist or mentally retarded.</p>

<p>Ts .: Levy also stated that he considers the great Russian thinkers and writers - Herzen, Pushkin, Turgenev - as liberal figures opposed to the Russian national and Eurasian idea. Why has the West since that time tried to perceive so great the great Russian people and interpret their activities only to their advantage?</p>

<p>AD: You know, among the great Russian thinkers, he also mentioned Elena Bonner, academician Sakharov, Anna Politkovskaya, Boris Nemtsov. That is, he generally put them in one row.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bernard-Henri Levy: ‚ÄúYou also have the tradition of Herzen, Pushkin, Turgenev, partly Sakharov, the entire glorious tradition of dissidents who fought against the totalitarianism of the Soviet Union and who waged this struggle in the name of individuality, subject rights and human rights &lt;‚Ä¶&gt;. Therefore, for me, when I call you a nihilist, when I say that Putin is a nihilist, that Moscow represents a painful atmosphere of nihilism, in which, by the way, real deaths occur - Anna Politkovskaya, Boris Nemtsov and many others killed in Moscow or in London - that‚Äôs what I mean. And I mean that, alas, for this great Russian civilization today in great Russia there is a bad, dark wind of nihilism in its own sense, Nazi and fascist ‚Äù(from the discussion of A. Dugin and B.-A. Levy).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ts .: And I also mentioned Solzhenitsyn here.</p>

<p>AD: Well, Solzhenitsyn is another question. Solzhenitsyn was just a nationalist, which, naturally, Levy did not know about, because Bernard-Henri Levy did not read Solzhenitsyn. He read the Wikipedia article on the ‚ÄúGulag Archipelago‚Äù and was sure that Solzhenitsyn is the same as himself. Absolutely not discovering Solzhenitsyn, who from the first to the last line, with all his anti-communism and anti-Sovietism, defends Slavophil traditional Russia.</p>

<p>Accordingly, if Levy had read at least a couple of pages of Solzhenitsyn, then, I think, he would have quickly ranked him among the enemies of an open society. But he doesn‚Äôt read anything, apparently. As for his ideas about Russian culture, then under the ‚Äúgreat Russians‚Äù he sees several random names from the 19th century that appear as Westerners, and Politkovskaya with Nemtsov, who by no means belong to the pantheon of Russian thought.</p>

<p>That is, in the situation with Levy, we are talking about the deepest ignorance. And I quoted French authors 20 times, which confused him. Either Georges Bataille, then Michel Foucault, then Guy Debord. I just pay great attention to the differences between these philosophers and thinkers and not their currency in one heap, they say, the French, and that‚Äôs it. And Levi‚Äôs Russians look different.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bernard-Henri Levy: ‚ÄúYour civilization, Russian, which I respect and respect, invented, for example, through Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe struggle against totalitarianism. What Solzhenitsyn did is incredible, and no one can take it from Russian culture. Numerous Western thinkers have tried to imagine freedom from totalitarianism, what it is, what it takes to fight, what is a concentration camp, and so on. And all thanks to the Russian man who created his masterpiece called the Gulag Archipelago. No one and nothing can take this from Russian civilization. In the same sense, Europe has also created several things that benefit all of humanity ‚Äù(from a discussion by A. Dugin and B.-A. Levy).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The funniest moment was know which one? It was no longer on stage, but behind the curtains. He tells me: ‚ÄúDo you know what is the most important crime of Putin? It consists in the fact that he erected a monument to Stalin in Georgia. ‚Äú I tell him: ‚ÄúGeorgia is not Russia.‚Äù Then he immediately got together and said: ‚ÄúSo, he lobbied for this through the embassy.‚Äù I was wondering if he would have said it on stage right now, he would have simply had no price. And this speaks of his horizons.</p>

<p>As for Pushkin, he was neither a Slavophile nor a Westerner, but represented both those and those. The speeches of the super-Slavophile Dostoevsky about Pushkin and another Slavophile-Gogol represent Pushkin in general as a fundamental figure of the Russian people. At the same time, yes, there is an interpretation of Pushkin as a Westerner by virtue of his interest in Western culture. Pushkin is a complex figure, and I stick to reading Pushkin through Gogol and Dostoevsky, through the Silver Age.</p>

<p>As for Herzen, he is, of course, a Westerner. But, as I noticed to the perplexed Levy, at the end of his life he switched to nationalist positions and regarded the West as a local and very selective source for strengthening the Russian national tradition.</p>

<p>C .: Is this one-sided interpretation of everything in a favorable light - is it still the ignorance of the liberal elites or is it a system that would further support liberalism?</p>

<p>AD: I must say that Levy himself began in general with moralism, that is, an extremely left-wing movement. Which he later abandoned in favor of big business. That is, he is a traitor to everything and everything. In fact, from the point of view of liberalism, all ideologies, right or left, which are not liberal, are enemies of an open society. According to the engaged liberals, all that is happening on the right is fascism, and what is happening on the left is communism. It turns out that only liberals have the right to political representation, right-wing liberals, left-wing liberals. But everyone who does not agree with liberalism, that is, the so-called ‚Äúilliberals‚Äù (as Levy himself spoke of), is reduced either to fascism or to communism. And on this basis they are crossed out. Accordingly, a completely totalitarian model arises.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bernard-Henri Levy: ‚ÄúSo, are you a racist, Mr. Dugin? I am glad to hear that you represent yourself as an adversary of racism. But I doubt your sincerity. A few days ago I read your book, The Conservative Revolution, page 256, where you write about Jews. I am not only interested in Jews, I am interested in everything, but it was written about them. And on this page you are talking about metaphysical rivalry and war between Aryans and Jews. And you say that this is a challenge, a debate not only of a century, but of all times. Thus, you are a clear anti-Semite ‚Äù(from the discussion of A. Dugin and B.-A. Levy).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But here is the interesting thing. I told him that I am opposed to liberalism, but at the same time I do not support fascism or communism, but call my position conditionally the fourth political theory. And this is the very moment when Levi has a short circuit. Because if I told him, for example, that I am a supporter of a new form of fascism, then this would be clear to him, as well as the defense of some new communism. Then he could classify and criticize my views with the help of the traditional liberal model.</p>

<p>But since he cannot classify my views, he finds himself in a battle with emptiness. That is why in the West there is such a great aggression in relation to my views. If they were fascist or communist, then it would be easier for them to polemicize and criticize.</p>

<p>Ts .: Levy did not distinguish between a national idea and what it spilled over into Nazi Germany. Why does he, the representative of France, who also suffered in the Second World War, not recognize the state‚Äôs right to support his nation, considers it fascism and a violation of the rights of an individual when the French saw what fascism means?</p>

<p>AD: This is part of liberal ideology. Liberals do not believe in the state, or rather, they believe in it very limitedly. The state, from the point of view of liberals, should train civil society. And this is the only meaning of the nation state. It is assumed that over time, people will overcome the state and will live in a single civil society system.</p>

<p>If a state insists that it is a value in itself, a carrier of sovereignty, has autonomy and an advantage over liberal ideologies, then in this case the state becomes an opponent of liberalism.</p>

<p>Alexander Dugin: ‚ÄúAs for the globalization process that you are describing. If it were as you say, we would not mind. If it was a dialogue in which everyone is involved - Christians, Muslims, Chinese, defending their values, if globalization was an open, honest and truly democratic dialogue to determine the best in all these civilizations, I think no one would rebel her ‚Äù(from the discussion of A. Dugin and B.-A. Levy).</p>

<p>What is interesting is what Levy has already said about this. He said earlier that America under Trump is no longer the state that safeguards the interests of global society, and therefore the center of globalization must move to Europe, which is more liberal and less state. It would seem that the globalists are behind the United States. Yes, but this is so, while the state defends globalist interests. Once the United States stands on the rails of national politics, Trump himself is immediately accused of anti-globalism.</p>

<p>C .: There are already Trump‚Äôs accusations of protectionism.</p>

<p>AD: Yes, what is protectionism there, fascism is simple. Such accusations. If you look at the controversy during his election campaign and immediately after, and now, then the liberal media do not call him anything but a fascist. They say that he is just a fascist and a Nazi. This has become simply an abusive term for them, which it is useless to fight, because such accusations stem from the specific ideology of the liberals. That is, first they find this label, hang it, and then repeat it again and again. And if this is repeated a thousand times, then everyone will believe that this is so.</p>

<p>That is, we say that modern liberalism is a form of ideological struggle. This is an aggressive, completely intolerant, obsessive, one-dimensional ideology. And this is precisely ideology, because there is nothing taken for granted in these statements of modern liberalism. These views cannot be combined with reality, it is an autonomous discourse.</p>

<p>Ts .: Levy said that ‚ÄúUkraine is older than Russia‚Äù and that Crimea was never Russian, but was conquered and the Russian boot set foot on it. If we talk about historical premises, it is clear that both statements are not related to reality. Is this another rhetorical instrument of the struggle of the liberals?</p>

<p>AD: I think that Levy is not only engaged, but also ignorant. He seriously thinks that Ukraine is a kind of state that has always existed, and some Russia broke away from it, which then won the Crimea from the great Ukraine. He sees it that way. By the way, he was in Kiev on the Maidan, urging the Ukrainian Nazis to genocide against the Russians. He is really a very engaged thinker, and, by the way, he is forbidden to enter the Russian Federation. Therefore, here he operates with the myths of Ukrainian Nazism.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bernard-Henri Levy: ‚ÄúWhen you say that Ukraine is a new state, how can you say that? Ukraine existed before Russia. Prince Vladimir, who was baptized and who brought Christianity to modern Ukraine and Russia, was Prince of Kiev, not Moscow. Therefore, Ukraine is an older country than Russia. This is the truth that revisionist historians in the Kremlin and around are trying to revise. Ukraine is an ancient nation. Just like the Crimea. And Crimea was included in Russia only because of the last colonial process. And what Putin has done in Crimea, what he is doing in Eastern Ukraine at that moment, what he does when he plays with fire and massacres in Syria, is contrary to the interests of our children and grandchildren ‚Äù(from a discussion by A. Dugin and B .-A. Levy).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But you need to understand what is at stake. After all, these myths serve for a very clear geopolitical goal, formulated by Brzezinski, whom I also met at one time. The point is that Russia could not again become an independent state, empire or a large space, and for this it is necessary to tear Ukraine away from it at any cost. And the West is engaged in this, and Levy is actively engaged in this, but only in theory. He will be ready to support the most idiotic myth if it is aimed at the benefit of this global idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe West.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt know, maybe he himself really believes in this nonsense, which he also suggested to the Nazis in Kiev. I won‚Äôt be surprised. But the fact is that in reality, with all this nonsense, the vector of the policy that he is promoting is quite understandable: to destroy relations between Russia and Ukraine, tear Ukraine in favor of the West, cursing Russia, overthrow those regimes in the Arab world that are the most stable national systems by promoting bloody chaos and dismemberment in the region.</p>

<p>Ts .: How then can we say that liberalism has entered the stage of crisis, if at the same time it is conducting large-scale expansion and undermining the regimes? Although the Middle East seems to have stopped this process?</p>

<p>AD: From the point of view of Levy, this process is far from over. What is happening now is not even a crisis of liberalism, as Putin and even Macron say so. Levy believes that liberalism is simply a technical malfunction, then it will surely recover, and therefore it is necessary to continue to carry out this Western hegemony at all costs, to save it. And that is why wherever some ethnic or national conflict begins, it is necessary to use the situation to promote their values.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bernard-Henri Levy: ‚ÄúThere was not a single crisis in Europe that Russia would not have encouraged. It cannot be calculated how many times in 2014 and 2015, Russian planes violated the air borders of Poland, Lithuania and sometimes even France. You know, just like me, in 2014 or 2015, Putin made a small statement, which plays chess very well, that you should once again check the legitimacy of the independence of the Baltic states. Therefore, today the one who truly represents imperialism, the one who really intervenes and sows disorder in the affairs of others, is Putin. And I don‚Äôt need to talk about America, where it has already been proven that Russia really intervened in the last election process ‚Äù(from the discussion by A. Dugin and B.-A. Levy).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, Levy has made great efforts to create an independent Kurdistan. First of all, it was important for him to weaken Iran in order to create a strategic barrier between southern Azerbaijan and Iran itself, as well as blackmail Turkish President Recep Erdogan, attack Bashar al-Assad and dismember Iraq. In general, Bernard-Henri Levy is one of the most terrible and bloody people. Moreover, he sincerely believes in what he is doing, with all his ignorance and the absurdity of his statements.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I would not discount it, because it is the West. This is not a man on his own, that‚Äôs what I want to say. This is not a person who presents his views. If this were so, it would be simply insignificant. But everything is much more serious, and he represents the views, including those of all our Westerners and modernists. They are the miasms that flow from Levi.</p>

<p>Ts .: What are the main consequences of such a liberal policy in the world now?</p>

<p>AD: The West sincerely believes that killing people in the name of liberalism and humanism is right. Actually, the group that now puts on Levy - and this is Clinton, Obama and the Democrats - they once coined the term ‚Äúhumanitarian bombing.‚Äù That is, in order to respect human rights, it is necessary to bomb people. That is, human rights must be protected by destroying the person himself.</p>

<p>Therefore, for them, rivers of blood shed in the name of human rights are not rivers of blood. And protection from this bloody horror is declared an act of terrorism. These are not just double standards, as the West thinks. With all the savagery and horrors, we must understand that we are dealing and will deal with it. There is no other West.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bernard-Henri Levy: ‚ÄúThe war in Syria and Libya is not a civil war. This is a war against the civilian population. The war of the state, the army against the civilian population. You are talking about ‚Äúrivers of blood.‚Äù In any case, these are rivers whose spillage was prevented by the West. This is the good that the West did in Libya. And these Western humanitarian efforts to save people from the barbarism of their own state cannot compare with what the big state of Russia is doing, with its large planes, with the gas of Bashar al-Assad, which should fuel the aggressive war of the butcher, who does not care about our discussion about civilizations , bridges, blocks, etc., which is just an executioner, which your president and Iran support today ‚Äù(from the discussion of A. Dugin and B.-A. Levy).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ts .: But what about the populists in Europe and the opposition to the global liberal course?</p>

<p>AD: She is - these are populists, this is Trump. But in this case, this Western opposition is also me. That West that is not Levy is us. Because the dominant Western elites are Levy. They are opposed by the people.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alexander Dugin: ‚ÄúI think that there are a lot of exaggerations and rhetorical data that I am not inclined to answer, but not because I do not have an answer. For example, on the issue of intervention. On the one hand, it was proved that there was no interference on our part in support of Trump, and there was interference in support of Hillary by some Russian oligarchs. The same can be said about the financing of extreme right-wing movements in Europe. There are many rumors about Russian intervention, the most absurd of which is about intervention in the crisis in Catalonia, but there is no evidence for this ‚Äù(from a discussion by A. Dugin and B.-A. Levy).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>C .: Double standards of Western liberalism - is it his hope for the future or is it something that will destroy him?</p>

<p>AD: I think that such a consistent and unequivocal defense of Western hegemony is not such a weak thing. Because they have their own arguments, the United States remains for them the main country, the most powerful country. All cultural, economic and educational models are in their hands. Their elite is united, and representatives of such ‚Äúnative‚Äù elites are being recruited into it - this happens in Russia, India, and China. They try to integrate them and make them their part.</p>

<p>They need such ‚Äúlessons of hatred‚Äù, they need an enemy, but simple and understandable. Enemies need to be reduced to fascists and communists, not without reason the West has already equated these terms. We laugh at Western fakes, but you understand that people who read the Western press, watch television, read blogs, who come to congresses and take part in liberal educational projects, is a tool for mobilization.</p>

<p>They are grinded that humanitarian bombing is good, human rights are good, populism is bad, all Russians are fascists, Muslims are fascists. These all absolutely idiotic cliches help mobilize liberal elites. And this is a mechanism for preparing a kind of liberal sectarians and fanatics.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bernard-Henri Levy: ‚ÄúWe have already experienced those times when the truth comes from above, as under Plato. She must be sought, sought sincerely and truly. And for this we do not need to interfere in the affairs of the state. We do not need the trolls that the Kremlin or anyone else is manipulating. We need readers, journalists, civil society, inspired by a sincere and genuine will to truth, to speak like Friedrich Nietzsche. I recommend that Russia do the same ‚Äù(from a discussion by A. Dugin and B.-A. Levy).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I agree that if you go too far and completely ignore reality, and Levy ignores reality, then the system becomes too hard and rigid, it does not enter into dialogue with anyone at all, does not perceive anyone and becomes pure totalitarianism. That is why Levy and the liberal elites, seeing an unprecedented upsurge in populist movements in Europe, entire parties for which Levy is a negative example, immediately call them fascists, they say that they are kept by Putin. They demonize them in the same way as demonize all those who are objectionable.</p>

<p>Therefore, this is the factor that weakens the global liberal system. Because very large civilizations - China, Russia, part of Europe, and America itself - already understand the complete failure of liberal discourse. I think Levy even helps people pull together in a hatred of liberalism.</p>

<p>Modern liberalism is extremely totalitarian and is no longer able to correct the course, it does not listen to anyone else and has lost touch with reality. For them it‚Äôs not so bad, because if you insist on something paranoid, you can convince people, you can make them follow you. The West and the liberals are doing this - fierce, hysterical, radical paranoid propaganda. But they are destroyed by the lack of ability to dialogue. They are not ready for a dialogue, even internal - with Trump, Bannon, with populist Europe. And even more so, they are not ready for dialogue with Russia, with the Islamic world, with China. It is easy to notice the signs of their end. When people wake up, liberals will be overthrown in all societies, and they can hardly hold on somewhere. Ultimately, liberalism can be punished and equated with fascism,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alexander Dugin: ‚ÄúWhen Bush was in Moscow during the US invasion of Iraq, he said:‚Äú Please be patient, and you will also have democracy, as in Iraq. ‚Äù Putin replied: ‚ÄúThank you, but we will find another way to build our society.‚Äù I think that the picture you provide is true, but it has nothing to do with modern Western society, where there is a purely totalitarian way of describing the facts, not in favor of a small group of owners of a particular media, but in favor of the political elite. And in this sense, they are a kind of Platonists, taking their truths from their liberal ideology; it is also something platonic. And the people rebel against this in different countries, and in the West too. I think that the wave of populism is precisely the failure of the Europeans, not the right or left wing,</p>

<p>Ts .: How should Russia act in these conditions in the future?</p>

<p>AD: Russia should become the rails along which the multipolar idea moves. We must become sleepers on this path, with our mind, our activity, our service to the Fatherland. We must put ourselves. See how many Russian people lay down so that we had such a country. All this is paid for in blood. And this requires us first of all intellectual efforts.</p>

<p>We remain Russian, but somehow more emotionally, heartily. And often we remain so in the process of our own destruction. In my opinion, we need discipline, utmost sobriety, utmost intellectual concentration. We are very scattered and scattered. If this is so, then we will not be able to pave ourselves the road to a multipolar future.</p>

<p>Ts .: On this path there can be no opposition from those who do not want multipolarity. What are the main levers of liberalism today with which it will struggle with conservative national ideas and try to maintain its influence in countries where people are already starting to abandon Western values?</p>

<p>AD: First - they will work with technological progress. They will make peoples and societies completely dependent on technology, more precisely, on virtuality. They hope to be saved by migrating to the virtual world. For example, programmers or other people whose lives are closely connected with gadgets represent a transitional generation of those people who will live in a virtual environment. Liberals claim to themselves determine the agenda in the new technocratic world. And this is their strategy.</p>

<p>The most interesting thing that will happen next. Ultimately, the goal is to interbreed man and machine, to merge their intellect. In fact, we are approaching the end of human history, and liberals are making this end. Temptations will spread through technocracy, so technocracy is generally the worst thing for a person of all that can be. Technocracy has its own logic - we must develop, because if we do not develop, then we will become backward. Therefore, we must spend more time in virtual space, so we must already replace some organs with electronic elements.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bernard-Henri Levy: ‚ÄúThere is a great struggle between liberal and illiberal values ‚Äã‚Äãthroughout the world. And this struggle has also affected our countries. You have liberals in Russia, and we have in Europe. And what is truly true is that liberalism is facing the same crisis of confidence that it faced in the 1930s or at the very beginning of the 20th century. But in this struggle, Mr. Dugin, I confirm today, since we are at the end of this discussion, we will be on opposite sides of the barricades ‚Äù(from the discussion by A. Dugin and B.-A. Levy).</p>

<p>The second argument for the survival of the liberals is material security. It will still be a temptation. And although in reality the middle class is shrinking or growing at a very slow pace, liberals will develop this well-being as an image. Well-being will attack people; the image of liberalism will embody wealth or well-being.</p>

<p>The third. I think that at some point the liberals will need an enemy or war. The enemy is very serious, a new enemy who can justify their existence by some terrible alternative. They tried to make such an enemy from Islamic fundamentalism, from Russia. But neither one nor the other copes with this function.</p>

<p>Something must happen in the spirit of the invasion of the Martians, or some kind of terrible epidemic that will take the lives of a billion people on Earth. Or some terrible technological disaster. That is, it already reminds scenarios of a science fiction movie or a novel. Because if you take a rational scenario, draw a straight line, taking the current state of liberalism, then after 10 years it will not be. They already understand this, and I think they are preparing radical solutions. Either biological weapons or a new world war.</p>

<p>Because usually, when it comes to the fundamental rethinking of the development path of civilization, terrible disasters occur. I am sure that such a scenario is already ready for them, and at some point, for one reason or another, sooner or later they will face the inevitability of its application.</p>

<p>Look here. The liberals will not explain how right they are to people when they turn their backs on them. This will not help them anymore, they have slipped into the level of banal statements, it is not even clear whether they believe in them themselves. They certainly do not intend to adapt liberalism to the new situation, and they are not able to do it. Only the toughest scenario remains. In order to save themselves as they are, they need to destroy an essential part of what already exists. This is the same liberal story - in order to protect human rights, it is necessary to kill people.</p>
